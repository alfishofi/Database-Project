\section{Principal Queries}

In this section we report the queries needed to perform some operations on the database:

\begin{enumerate}
\item 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Print the list of Reports that have the priority equal or less than 8 and the deadline before 2023.03.10.


        \begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL,
        keywordstyle=\color{blue},
        stringstyle=\color{mauve},
        showstringspaces=false,
        basicstyle=\ttfamily\footnotesize]
            SELECT (Report.Report\_ID)
            FROM D1.Report
            WHERE Report.Priority <= 8 AND Report.Deadline < '2023.03.10'; 
        \end{lstlisting}
        

  \item Find the number of Reports that have the priority equal or less than 8 and the deadline before 2023.03.10.
        \begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL,
        keywordstyle=\color{blue},
        stringstyle=\color{mauve},
        showstringspaces=false,
        basicstyle=\ttfamily\footnotesize]
            SELECT Count(Report.Report\_ID)
            FROM D1.Report
            WHERE Report.Priority <= 8 AND Report.Deadline < '2023.03.10'; 
        \end{lstlisting}

\end{enumerate}

    \item Retrieve a list of users together with their related information email, first\_name, last\_name, togther with the Branch\_ID they belong to using INNER JOIN.


        \begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL,
        keywordstyle=\color{blue},
        stringstyle=\color{mauve},
        showstringspaces=false,
        basicstyle=\ttfamily\footnotesize]
            SELECT u.email, u.first\_name, u.last\_name, b.Branch\_ID as Branch
            FROM D1.User as u
            INNER JOIN D1.Branch as b ON u.B\_ID= b.Branch\_ID;
        \end{lstlisting}
        
  \item Retrieve a list of users together with their related information email, first\_name, last\_name, togther with their corresponding ROLE using LEFT JOIN.



    \begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL,
        keywordstyle=\color{blue},
        stringstyle=\color{mauve},
        showstringspaces=false,
        basicstyle=\ttfamily\footnotesize]
        SELECT u.Email, u.first\_name, u.last\_name, r.Role\_ID as Role
        FROM D1.User as u
        LEFT JOIN D1.Role as r ON u.R\_ID = r.Role\_ID
     \end{lstlisting}        
     
 \item Retrieve a list of reports together with their report id, 
present budget amount needed which their present budget is more than amount needed. 
Also retrieve those which their present amount is below 1000.



    \begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL,
        keywordstyle=\color{blue},
        stringstyle=\color{mauve},
        showstringspaces=false,
        basicstyle=\ttfamily\footnotesize]
       SELECT report\_id, amount\_present, amoun\_needed
       FROM D1.report AS R INNER JOIN D1.budget as B
        ON R.b\_id = B.budget\_id
    WHERE amount\_present > amount\_needed
    UNION
    SELECT report\_id, amount\_present, amount\_needed
    FROM D1.report AS R INNER JOIN D1.budget as B
    ON R.b\_id = B.budget\_id
    WHERE amount\_present::numeric::int < 1000
     \end{lstlisting}           
\item For each Branch get the list of the users that are not creators

            ON U.email = R.u\_id
            FULL JOIN D1.branch as B

            WHERE u\_id IS NULL
     \end{lstlisting}   
\item Retrieve a list of project together with their report id, 
present budget amount needed which their present budget is more than amount needed. 
Also retrieve those which their amount needed is below 30000.

  \end{lstlisting}
  
\item Find the list of the Feedback\_ID and the status\_id that has 
the variable Current equal to True , also with the Report\_ID  
that has the deadline before 20/02/2022.
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL,
